===================================
True Positive(TP) Process Patterns
===================================
True positive process alerts commonly include abnormal context or behavior, such as:

- Use of Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins)  
  (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `wmic.exe`)

- Execution from user-writable directories
  - `Downloads`
  - `Temp`
  - `AppData`

- Suspicious parent–child relationships
  - Office applications spawning scripts
  - PowerShell launching system utilities

- Access to sensitive resources (e.g., financial or HR file shares)

- Follow-on activity:
  - File staging or compression
  - Network share access
  - Credential usage

- Activity occurring outside normal business hours

Example pattern
powershell.exe -> net.exe -> sensitive file share access -> archive creation
