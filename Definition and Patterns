True Positive (TP) 
An alert that correctly identifies malicious or unauthorized activity.

False Positive (FP)
An alert triggered by legitimate, expected, or authorized behavior.

===================================
True Positive(TP) Process Patterns
===================================
True positive process alerts commonly include abnormal context or behavior, such as:

- Use of Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins)  
  (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `wmic.exe`)

- Execution from user-writable directories
  - `Downloads`
  - `Temp`
  - `AppData`

- Suspicious parent–child relationships
  - Office applications spawning scripts
  - PowerShell launching system utilities

- Access to sensitive resources (e.g., financial or HR file shares)

- Follow-on activity:
  - File staging or compression
  - Network share access
  - Credential usage

- Activity occurring outside normal business hours

Example pattern
powershell.exe -> net.exe -> sensitive file share access -> archive creation

=====================================
False Positive (FP) Process Patterns
=====================================
False positives typically involve legitimate Windows system activity, including:

- Known Windows binaries:
  - `TrustedInstaller.exe`
  - `WUDFHost.exe`
  - `rdpclip.exe`
  - `svchost.exe`

- Execution from default system paths:
  - `C:\Windows\System32`
  - `C:\Windows\Servicing`

- Expected parent processes:
  - `services.exe`
  - `svchost.exe`

- Standard command-line arguments

- Activity consistent with:
  - Windows updates
  - Driver initialization
  - Remote Desktop sessions
  - Routine system maintenance

Example pattern:
services.exe -> WUDFHost.exe (standard UMDF parameters)
