These observations were made during a SOC simulation exercise on TryHackMe, specifically the module:

SOC Simulation -> Unfolding Phishing (Difficulty: Medium)

The analysis focuses on two common alert categories:

Process execution monitoring (endpoint security)
Phishing and email-based threats

The goal is to demonstrate practical SOC triage skills, alert validation logic, and detection tuning awareness.
